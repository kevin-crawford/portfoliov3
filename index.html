					<h3>Communication</h3>
					<p>Confident in sharing my ideas in meetings,
						with teams and customers. Listen, the best communicators spend as much time listening as they do talking.

					<h3>Version Control</h3>

						<i class="fas fa-vial"></i>
					<h3>Unit Testing</h3>
					<p>Unit testings primary benefit is that it makes the coding process
							more agile. When you add more and more features to a software, you
							sometimes need to change old design and code. But changing already
							tested code is both risky and costly.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="skills-container">
						<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>
					<h3>Command Line</h3>
					<p>Command Line Interfaces (CLI) improve efficiency through its simple
							design and minimal system resource use. Ability to navigate such
							systems lead to better control and faster development speeds.</p>
